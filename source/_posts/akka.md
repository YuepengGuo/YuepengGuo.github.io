## Responsive

 * Resilient: Applications that can heal themselves, which means they can recover from failure, and will always be responsive, even in case of failure like if we get errors or exceptions

 * Elastic: A system which is responsive under varying amount of workload, that is, the system always remains responsive, irrespective of increasing or decreasing traffic, by increasing or decreasing the resources allocated to service this workload

 * Message Driven: A system whose components are loosely coupled with each other and communicate using asynchronous message passing, and which reacts to those messages by taking an action
